"""
This module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern
in several classic forms:
   SUMMING:    total = total + number
   COUNTING:   count = count + 1
   AVERAGING:  summing and counting combined
and
   FACTORIAL:  x = x * k

Subsequent modules let you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern
in its "in graphics" form:
   IN GRAPHICS:   x = x + pixels

Authors: David Mutchler, Dave Fisher, Valerie Galluzzi, Amanda Stouder,
         their colleagues and Zhengxiao Zou.

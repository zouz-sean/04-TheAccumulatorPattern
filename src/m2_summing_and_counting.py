This module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern in classic forms:
   SUMMING:    total = total + number
   COUNTING:   count = count + 1

A subsequent module lets you practice the ACCUMULATOR pattern
in another classic form:
   IN GRAPHICS:   x = x + pixels

    #   Step 2:  Pick a test case:  numbers that you could send as

    #
    #   Step 3: Figure out (by hand, or by trusting a test case that
    #     your instructor provided in the green doc-string)
    #     the CORRECT (EXPECTED) answer for your test case.
    #
    #   Step 4: Write code that prints both the EXPECTED answer
    #     and the ACTUAL answer returned when you call the function.
